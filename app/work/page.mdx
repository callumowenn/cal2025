# Work üë®‚Äçüíª

As a technologist at the intersection of software and broadcast, I am experienced and confident researching, implementing, and maintaining modern infrastructure across data centres, broadcast facilities, and codebases.

I am passionate about harnessing innovation to bring powerful and positive experiences to people, fascinated by the complex relationship between media, technology, and society.

With an empathetic approach to Human-Computer Interaction, my research is primarily concerned with how multidisciplinary wisdom may inform the design of responsible technology, and how communities may integrate such systems into civic life to empower digital social innovation.
